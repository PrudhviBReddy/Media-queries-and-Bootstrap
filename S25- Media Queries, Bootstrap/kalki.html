              <strong>Kalki 2898 AD</strong>'Kalki 2898 AD' is set in the post-apocalyptic time. It's partially based on the Kalki purana and beautifully combines science-fiction with Indian mythology. However, it's purely a work of fiction and a re-imagination by director Nag Ashwin, of a world devoid of nature and full of darkness.

              The film is set in Kashi, which is considered the first city in the world as per the legends. Once celebrated for its otherworldliness, wisdom, and divinity, the city has now turned into a barren piece of rotten land. The life out of Kashi has been sucked by the 'complex', a giant futuristic building created by the ruler of the new world - Supreme Yaskin (Kamal Haasan as the main antagonist). He is aware of his destiny and is on a mission to find a woman who can keep a foetus in her womb for at least 150 days.<br><br>
              This is the 'Kalyuga' and all fertile women on the planet are taken to the complex for the big experiment. When Yaskin's team, which includes the best of the minds from all across the world, fails to find that one woman, he creates havoc. Meanwhile, his commander (Saswata Chatterjee) makes his personal mission to find the magical city of 'Shambhala', the only place left on earth where Supreme Yaskin's army hasn't reached, or in other words, caused destruction.<br><br>
              Enters Deepika Padukone as 'Sum 80', an employee at the 'complex' who's given the job of assisting the fertile women with food and medicine. Except that she, who was considered infertile for ages, is five-months pregnant. Sumati manages to hide her pregnancy for five months in the complex, but for how long?<br><br>
              In this world where darkness continues to gobble everything - from beauty to humanity - there's a section of people called 'rebels' who are waiting for the ultimate arrival of God 'Kalki' on earth. They believe in the old legends of the last Lord Vishnu avatar taking birth to end evil and, above all, everything that Supreme Yaskin stands for. Lord Kalki is expected to reset the world in order and bring back the very things that make it worth living. Shambhala is the city of rebels, and they have managed to keep it hidden from Supreme Yaskin and his army for the longest time. Until they can't.

            The journey between the birth of God and the end of 'kalyuga' is not easy. The moment the commander knows about Sumati's pregnancy, he orders a bounty on her head. The dealings in this world happen via 'units'. The bounty on Sumati's head is '5 million units'. Enters Prabhas's Bhairavaa, a nonchalant orphan who's only motivation in life is 'units' (money). He begins to chase Sumati to bring her to the complex and finally get his prize. Little does he know that the 'maa' is under the protection of one of the most fierce warriors from Mahabharata - Ashwatthama. Enters Amitabh Bachchan.<br><br>
            As per mythology, Ashwatthama was cursed by Lord Krishna and was forced to wander around earth with the only purpose of protecting His next avatar - Kalki. There are signs that he successfully reads and begins the mission of searching for Sumati and protecting the foetus. His face-off with Bhairavaa makes for one of the most intriguing moments in the film. And it happens twice.

            In Nag Ashwin's Kalki cinematic universe, the post-apocalyptic world witnesses many reincarnations. Will Ashwatthama be able to save Sumati and her unborn child? Will Bhairavaa realise his real power? And will Supreme Yaskin see the end of his world, and eventually his own self? This is a creative imagination where sci-fi meets Hindu purans. And here, everything seems possible.
